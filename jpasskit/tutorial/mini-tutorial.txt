For those new to Apple PassKit and creating passes, this mini tutorial should help get you going. Before we use jpasskit, there's a couple of things you need.
1. An apple developer account
2. A Mac running OSX
3. Java

If don't have these three things, it will be difficult to follow the instructions in the tutorial. The tutorial is divided into three steps. Step 1 guides you through the certificate creation on Apple's developer website. Step 2 gives you an example of how to use jpasskit to create a pass.

Step 1
The first thing you need to do is create a passkit identifier. To do that, you need to have a apple developer license and a Mac. Assuming you have both, follow these steps.

1. Open a browser and go to http://developer.apple.com
2. Click Member Center and login
3. If you belong to more than 1 team, select the team
4. Click on Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
5. Click Identifiers in iOS Apps
6. Click Pass Type IDs
7. Click the + icon to add a new Pass Type ID
8. Enter something descriptive for the description
9. Enter an identifier. It has to start with "pass". After that, apple recommends reverse-domain name. For example, if your business is supercoolapp.com, the reverse would be com.supercoolapp. The pass identifier might be pass.com.supercoolapp.generic
10. click "register" to create the identifier
11. click done. this will show your pass type id
12. click the pass type id you just created
13. click edit
14. click Create Certificate. It will sow you instructions for keychain
15. Open apple Keychain app on your Mac
16. Click Keychain Access and select Certificate Assistant -> Request a certificate from a certificate authority
17. select the email associated with your account
18. enter a name for common name
19. check Save to disk
20. click continue
21. for Save As, edit the name of the file
22. click Save
23. click done
24. Go back to the borwser and click Continue
25. Click choose File
26. Select the new certSigningRequest file you just created and click Choose
27. Click Generate
28. Click download. It will go into your downloads
29. click Done
30. Click your downloads to view the new certificate
31. Click the new cert and keychain will add it
32. Open keychain and the new cert will be listed under My Certificates
33. Select the new cert
34. Click the arrow to show the private key
35. Select the private key
36. Click File -> Export items
37. Enter a name for the private key. It should have .p12 for the file extension
38. Click Save
39. Enter a password to protect the private key and verify the password
40. Click Ok
41. It will prompt you for your Mac login password. Enter your password and click Allow

At this point you have the certificate and the private key you need for Jpasskit. You don't need to do anything special to the p12 file, just use it as is.

Step 2
Checkout Jpasskit from github with this command "git clone https://github.com/drallgood/jpasskit" or fork it on github. Either way will work. Start by making a simple java class with a main method and paste this code into the method.

        String appleWWDRCA = "passbook/AppleWWDRCA.pem"; // this is apple's developer relation cert
        String privateKeyPath = "./privateKey.p12"; // the private key you exported from keychain
        String privateKeyPassword = "password"; // the password you used to export
        try {
          
            PKSigningInformation pkSigningInformation = PKSigningInformationUtil().loadSigningInformationFromPKCS12AndIntermediateCertificate(privateKeyPath,
                                                                        privateKeyPassword, appleWWDRCA);
           
            PKPass pass = new PKPass();
            pass.setPassTypeIdentifier("pass.com.yourdomain.type");
            pass.setAuthenticationToken("vxwxd7J8AlNNFPS8k0a0FfUFtq0ewzFdc");
            pass.setSerialNumber("12345678000");
            pass.setTeamIdentifier("abcdefg"); // replace this with your team ID
            pass.setOrganizationName("your org");
            pass.setDescription("some description");
            pass.setLogoText("some logo text");

            pass.setBarcodes(Arrays.asList(
                PKBarcode.builder()
                .format(PKBarcodeFormat.PKBarcodeFormatQR)
                .message("123456789")
                .messageEncoding(Charset.forName("iso-8859-1"))
                .build()
            ));

            PKGenericPass generic = new PKGenericPass();
            List<PKField> primaryFields = new ArrayList<PKField>();
            PKField member = new PKField();
            member.setKey("mykey"); // some unique key for primary field
            member.setValue("myvalue"); // some value
            primaryFields.add(member);
            generic.setPrimaryFields(primaryFields);
            pass.setGeneric(generic);
           
            PKLocation location = new PKLocation();
            location.setLatitude(37.33182); // replace with some lat
            location.setLongitude(-122.03118); // replace with some long
            List<PKLocation> locations = new ArrayList<PKLocation>();
            locations.add(location);
            pass.setLocations(locations);
           
            if (pass.isValid()) {
                String pathToTemplateDirectory = "./mypass.raw"; // replace with your folder with the icons
                byte[] passZipAsByteArray = PKFileBasedSigningUtil().createSignedAndZippedPkPassArchive(pass, pathToTemplateDirectory,
                                                            pkSigningInformation);
               
                String outputFile = "./mypass.pkpass"; // change the name of the pass
                ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(passZipAsByteArray);
                IOUtils.copy(inputStream, new FileOutputStream(outputFile));
                System.out.println("Done!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("the pass is NOT Valid man!!!");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.out.println("failed!");
        }

After you replace the values, run the class. At minimum you will need to change the following:

    path to your private key file
    password for the private key
    the passTypeIdentifier
    team identifier
    path to the raw pass files

Jpasskit includes the stock AppleWWDRCA certificate in src/test/resources folder. Either appleWWDRCA.cer or pem file will work in JPasskit. Note that if any certificate is expired, you won't be able to create a pass. One thing you don't want to do is try to sign the pass with your pass certificate. Jpasskit will sign it and create the package, but iOS device won't be able to verify the pass. You'll get an error saying it couldn't validate the intermediate certificate.
